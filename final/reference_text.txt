 There are like 10 different methods to detect them, to quantify them,
 to decide what is an outlier, what isn't an outlier.
 And then you need to decide whether you keep them or remove them.
 And if you remove them, you need to argument why you remove them. 
 But then depending on whether you remove them, the results might be a bit different. 
 So I was dealing with this shit today.
